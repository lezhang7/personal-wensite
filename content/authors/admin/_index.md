Hi there, I am an upcoming M.Sc. student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and  [Université de Montréal](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/) advised by Prof . [Aishwarya Agrawal](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~agrawal/) in the areas of Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Cross Vision-Language Learning. My research goal is to enable machines to perceive and interact with the world and people intelligently.

Perviously, I obtained my B.Eng in Biomedical Engineering from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). I was a  member of [Fudan DISC](http://fnlpsds.com/)  under the supervision of [Prof. Zhongyu Wei](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zywei/) at Fudan. Besides, I conducted a summer research project with the guide from [Prof. Diyi Yang](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dyang888/), and I was a research Intern at [Shanghai AI Lab ](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), under the supervision of Dr. [Siqi Sun](https://intersun.github.io/).
