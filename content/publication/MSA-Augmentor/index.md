abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have revolutionized protein folding research, and AlphaFold2 (AF2)  excels in performance and atomic-level accuracy, attracting a growing amount of attention to the domain. Since co-evolution is a vital factor in predicting protein structure, AF2's prediction quality is heavily influenced by the number of sequences (depth) of multiple sequence alignment (MSA), which involves extensively searching a vast protein database for similar protein sequences. It should be noted, however, that not all protein sequences have rich homologous families, so the AF2's results may degenerate on such queries and, in some cases, even fail to yield meaningful results. Based on a protein-specific attention mechanism and large-scale MSAs, we propose a novel generative language model, MSA-Augmentor, that can generate meaningful protein sequences not found in databases yet useful for providing co-evolutionary information. As a result, these shallow MSA will be enhanced with sequences generated by pre-trained MSA-Augmentor to allow more accurate structural property predictions. The experiments on CASP14 show that the model is capable of generating de novo sequences that retain co-evolutionary knowledge with inferior MSAs and improving the quality of protein structure prediction simultaneously.
